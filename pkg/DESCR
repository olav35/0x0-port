0x0 is a command line interface to https://0x0.st. It supports all the features
of https://0x0.st which are local file upload, remote file upload and URL
shortening.

It handles errors gracefully by attempting to catch them locally(without making
a request) when possible and displaying the HTTP status code when the requests
fail.
